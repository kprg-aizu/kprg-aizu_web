# Hello World!

```Verilog
$display("Hello World!")
```

Hi! This is our new blog where we will share some technical content. Our group's moments are posted [here](https://klab-aizu.github.io/moments/).

In this blog, our posts will cover topics such as Spiking Neural Networks, chip design, and more. We aim to provide general information for educational purposes.

From time to time, we may also share content that is not directly related to our research but still reflects aspects of our everyday life as researchers.  

Stay curious, keep building, and catch you in the next post.
